# Eyed
Game for Ludum Dare #32

2D platformer for 2-3 players, the main objective is to kill your friend by your very own eye. Or by his eye. Or whose eye was it anyways? 


RULES 
----- 

- Jump around and try to kill your opponents. 
- You shoot in the direction of your movement, even up/down. 
- You are not your eye, you are your body. 
- Whenever you shoot your eye, it becomes "hot", that means it kills every one, even you. 
- When the hot eye slows down, it becomes cool and you can pick it up again. 
- You can pick up any eye, even your opponents. 
- When you die, you immediately respawn. 
- When you respawn, you are protected for two seconds.
