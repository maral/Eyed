Game for [Ludum Dare #32](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/04/15/welcome-to-ludum-dare-32/), a 48 hours competition in creating games from scratch. This round's topic was "An Unconventional Weapon". All code and graphics was made by me only in those 48 hours. It's however possible that I will enhance the game later on.

2D platformer for 2-3 players, the main objective is to kill your friend by your very own eye. Or by his eye. Or whose eye was it anyways? 


RULES 
----- 

- Jump around and try to kill your opponents. 
- You shoot in the direction of your movement, even up/down. 
- You are not your eye, you are your body. 
- Whenever you shoot your eye, it becomes "hot", that means it kills every one, even you. 
- When the hot eye slows down, it becomes cool and you can pick it up again. 
- You can pick up any eye, even your opponents. 
- When you die, you immediately respawn. 
- When you respawn, you are protected for two seconds.
